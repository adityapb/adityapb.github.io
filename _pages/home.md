### Welcome!

Hi! I am Aditya. I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My primary research interests are in the area of 
parallel programming, compilers, and scientific computing. I am a graduate 
research assistant at the [Parallel Programming Lab](http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/).
I am currently working as an HPC Architect Intern at NVIDIA in Santa Clara.

Before coming to UIUC, I spent 2 years working in the cloud computing team in
the Risk Division at Goldman Sachs.
I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) 
in 2019 with a Bachelors and Masters in Aerospace Engineering.
